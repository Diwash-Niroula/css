        <p>A club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
            So the bar is where I go (Mm)<br>
            Me and my friends at the table doin' shots<br>
            Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)<br>
            And you come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
            And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)<br>
            Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
            And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like</p>

        <p class="key-line">Girl, you know I want your love<br>
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
            Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
            I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
            Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"<br>
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
            Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
            Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm</p>

        <p>I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
            We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
            Although my heart is fallin' too<br>
            I'm in love with your body<br>
            And last night, you were in my room<br>
            And now my bed sheets smell like you<br>
            Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new<br>
            Well, I'm in love with your body</p>

        <p class="key-line">Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I<br>
            Well, I'm in love with your body<br>
            Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I<br>
            Well, I'm in love with your body<br>
            Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I<br>
            Well, I'm in love with your body<br>
            Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new<br>
            I'm in love with the shape of you</p>

        <p>One week in, we let the story begin<br>
            We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)<br>
            You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat<br>
            Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)<br>
            We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
            And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)<br>
            And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat<br>
            Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like</p>

        <p class="key-line">Girl, you know I want your love<br>
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
            Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
            I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
            Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"<br>
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
            Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
            Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm</p>

        <p>I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
            We push and pull like a magnet do<br>

            I'm in love with your body<br>
